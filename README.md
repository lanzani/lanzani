I repeatedly fall into rabbit holes, sometimes I got pen and paper with me, so I can share what is interesting.

# About me
Formally, I'm a passionate **software engineer** based in Milano with strong theoretical knowledge and an eye for details. 

I use **machine learning** and **computer vision** to solve real life problems since python 2.7, developing **minimum viable products** and **proof of concept** applications.
